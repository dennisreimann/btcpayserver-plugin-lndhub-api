# LNDhub API

A plugin for [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver) to add a LNDhub-compatible API for stores.
This means that your store's Lightning wallet can be used with the following wallet apps:

* [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/)
* [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/)
* [Alby](https://getalby.com/)

These wallets offer import features, so that you can easily import your store's Lightning wallets into these apps.

:::tip NOTE
The prerequisite for a Lightning wallet to be accessible like this is enabling the plugin for your store.
Please note that this offers full access to the Lightning node that is connected to the store, not just the BTCPay Server-related activity.
:::

## Importing the wallet

On the LNDhub API settings page you will find the "Connect LNDhub-compatible wallet" section.
It has a QR code and the Access URL, which contain the details (server URL and credentials) to connect the apps.

:::danger WARNING
The credentials allow unrestricted access to your store's Lightning node.
Treat the QR code and Access URL as confidential information!
